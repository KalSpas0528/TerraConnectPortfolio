      <!-- Early Stages -->
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>Week 1 - Initial Setup</h3>
        <p>
          TerraConnect started with the implementation of an interactive map using Leaflet.js, enabling users to click on any country and view its Wikipedia summary. The foundational work focused on mapping and setting up the API structure for future features.

        <h3>Week 6 - Country Guessing Game & Local Storage</h3>
        <p>
          The Country Guessing Game feature was added, allowing users to challenge themselves by guessing countries based on the map. I also integrated local storage to track user progress, such as countries visited in the game.

    <!-- Challenges and Roadblocks -->
    <section class="challenges">
      <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
      <p>Throughout the development process, several challenges were overcome:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>News Integration:</strong> Initially, I tested different methods for integrating live news, including APIs, web scraping, and RSS feeds. Ultimately, I chose the GNews API for its reliability and ease of integration.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Ensuring that the map was responsive and that the app performed well on both desktop and mobile required balancing rich interactivity with smooth user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Junior Explorer Mode:</strong> Developing a safe and engaging experience for younger users required careful planning and restructuring of the application architecture.</li>
