      <h2>TerraConnect: Global Interactive News Map</h2>
      <p>
        TerraConnect is a web application that blends interactive geography exploration with real-time data, and computer/data science using Leaflet.js, REST Countries API, Wikipedia, and GNews. It features accessible UI/UX design, gamified learning tools, and educational modes to make global exploration exciting and informative for all ages.
      </p>
      <p>
      As a young child, I was always fascinated with Geography and world maps. I would spend hours on google maps strolling through different countries and environments. I always wished there was a specific app that could tailor to young students as passionate as I was. That is why a big component of TerraConnect is education and specifically to young learners.
